1. Write script that takes filename as argument. The file given as argument would contain absolute path of files/folders in current system to be backed up. Create folder in current working directory with name YYYY­mm­dd­HH­mm­ss and create copy of all folders and files with ownership, timestamp, permissions and full path information in created folder.  
For example if argument is backup.txt and backup.txt contains:  
/etc/hosts
/var/lib/mysql   
then create folder 2015­09­27­18­52­41 and create sub­folder /etc and sub­tree /var/lib/mysql inside folder 2015-­09-­27-­18-­52-­41. Then copy file /etc/hosts and complete contents of folder /var/lib/mysql to newly created /etc/hosts and /var/lib/mysql folders. This is all assuming user tried to run script file for backup at 06:52:41pm on 27th September,2015. Archive all folders whose backup date is less than 06:52:41pm on 27th September,2015. Execute this shell script as cron job.


2. Write a script to give me a list of all files in a directory hierarchy sorted by size. This implies that you should give me just the file names, and not the complete path, for all files in the specified directory as well as the sub­directories underneath. If there are any files with size zero, ask the user whether to delete those files (giving relative path name for the file, relative to current directory), and delete them if the user says yes. The script should allow for directories to be specified as command line parameters, and use the current directory as default if no directory is specified on the command line.  
Check if any of the file name ends with '<Terminating_String>', rename the file by removing <Terminating_String>. if the file­name is '<Terminating_String>' rename it to 'razorthink_<WORKING_DIRECTORY>'.  
Example: if scriptname is 'cleandir', usage should be 'cleandir <Directory_To_Be_Listed> <Terminating_String>'
